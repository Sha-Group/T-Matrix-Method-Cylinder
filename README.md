The T-matrix of a single cylinder can be calculated by generalized reflection coefficient method, then a T-matrix equation is formed for the multiple scattering problem. This method can also be used for approximately estimating the RCS of long and thin 3-D cylinders.  

Notice: Large number of Mie series is needed for larger-scale problem. T-matrix method is suitable for calculating the scattering of many compact (~10 wavelength) scatters.
